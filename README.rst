racket-scratch
==============

A rapid prototyping UX for Racket programming in Emacs, based on versioned and sessioned "scratch" buffers.

In the future, besides being usable at all (it's still in development!), this may be generalized for use with other languages and authoring settings in general.

See https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode/issues/628 for background and motivation.
