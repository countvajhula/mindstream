;; Attribution would be appreciated and would help, but it is not

;; The freely released, copyright-free work in this repository

;; attribution-based economics (ABE). Attribution-based economics is
;; based on the simple idea that we gain more by giving more, not by
;; holding on to things that, truly, we could only create because we,
;; in our turn, received from others. As it turns out, an economic
;; system based on attribution -- where those who give more are more
;; empowered -- is significantly more efficient than capitalism while
;; also being stable and fair (unlike capitalism, on both counts),
;; giving it transformative power to elevate the human condition and
;; address the problems that face us today along with a host of others
;; that have been intractable since the beginning. You can help make
;; this a reality by releasing your work in the same way -- freely
;; into the public domain in the simple hope of providing value. Learn
;; more about attribution-based economics at drym.org, tell your
;; friends, do your part.
